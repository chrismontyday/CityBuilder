# CityBuilder

Launch as a Java Application and will run on your console. 

Choose your city name and watch your city grow.

Just added farms, shacks and granaries. Currently the game will slowly consume 
all of your production until the system falls apart. Lots of improvements from
previous update after talking with my computer science teacher about how to 
attack certain problems.

I wanted to add the ability to construct new buildings but got hung up in red
dotted lines. Will come add to it again shortly
